## Static Site Generators

The [Troika](programming#troika) of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/oyn-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) website programming languages have become standard for creating website pages. Web browser interprets the standard [Troika](programming#troika) languages and renders the website.

The job of a static site generators is compile the website pages written in[Troika](programming#troika) and non troika programming languages such as Markdown, into a single file containing a combination of standard [Troika](programming#troika) languages web for browsers to interpret.

Web browsers loads the website single file from the deployment server, interprets and renders website pages.
