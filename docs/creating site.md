# Creating a Site

!!! note

    This site is built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

    - It's just Markdown  
    Focus on the content of your documentation and create a professional static site in minutes. No need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript – let Material for MkDocs do the heavy lifting for you.

    - Works on all devices  
    Serve your documentation with confidence – Material for MkDocs automatically adapts to perfectly fit the available screen estate, no matter the type or size of the viewing device. Desktop. Tablet. Mobile. All great.

```pip install mkdocs-material```

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies: MkDocs, Markdown, Pygments and Python Markdown Extensions. Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately.

```mkdocs build```

```mkdocs serve```
