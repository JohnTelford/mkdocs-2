title: Defect Remediation Costs
---

The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.

Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

The early defect detection mechanisms built into iterative development and a static site generator are:

- [VScode](developmenttools#vscode) editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors

- Fast refresh live-editing quickly showing changes and any runtime errors while typing

- Team members deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes, to private websites where stakeholders can see them and give feedback.  See [Preview Deployments](glossary#preview-deployments)
